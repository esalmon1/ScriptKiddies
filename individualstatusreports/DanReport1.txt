Status Report 1:
Section 1:
Section 2: This week we worked on creating our project board where we will have out
incoming and outgoing project tasks and their completion on them. We ran into a little trouble
understanding the instructions of what the assignment was asking for but with proper
communication we figured it out. We did a good job splitting up the work that we had to get
done, evenly amongst ourselves and we deemed that the last person to finish their part of the
project would have to be the one who turns it in for the group. WE made alot of user stories this
week that helped define the actions we would need to accomplish for our customers to
experience the most satisfaction. We still need to fully establish a git repository for the team to
use and make changes on.
Section 3: in looking at this weeks agenda it seems to be like we do not have a whole
ton of specific group work but I would like to keep adding the necessary files to our repository in
order to keep track of everything. We will work together on making the base of the program. The
fundamentals that will consist of what we need for the project.
