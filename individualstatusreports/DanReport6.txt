Section 1: This coming week we are going to work on adding more features to the mvp that we 
have
Section 2: I’ve made a lot of progress trying to format code and add things from the flask apps to 
our mvp. currently we are working on adding the user login and register function. This has been 
difficult for me because I am behind on the flask apps, and I am continuously running into errors 
that I am unsure of their origin. I have been spending multiple hours this week working and 
trying my best to get flask apps done as well as add code to our project. I am at a point where I 
really need to talk with our TA because my flask won’t run for our project and Is giving me the 
same consistent errors. Working with this team is hard and frustrating because the one person 
who’s flask app is working is refusing to do any work on the project because he did a lot of work 
for the last sprint. Really makes the whole team thing feel like a lot less of a team.
Section 3: this week We need to work on getting the flask app running and implementing some 
of the more abstract features to the code. I will be working on our code and making changes all 
night hoping to make some progress.
