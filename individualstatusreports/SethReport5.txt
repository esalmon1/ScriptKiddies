1. This coming week along with finishing the sprint for the week we are going to find a time where we can all meet in the library and work on getting the project started. We want to have a home page made in HTML and get the basics of the project going so that we will not be drowning towards the end of the semester.

2. We worked on the solor styling of our website as well as making sure the webstie looks great. 

3. We will be adding different features using the existing route. While also making sure that the CSS styles run through.
