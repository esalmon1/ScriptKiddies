Individual Status Report 6
Ted Salmon

Last Week's Goals
- Complete milestone on time

Individual Progress
Did: 
- Always start with a Pull
- Completed a section from milestone; testing.
- Implemented own flask06.py for our previous work

Learned: 
- How to implement a search function
- How to pull without saving it, but storing it to backup your previous work then pull it to repository 

Troubles:
- Unfortunately my flask won't run. I believe its to do with my flask installation? I'm seeking help tomorrow 
Stuck:
- With every project that is requiring me to run flask to show my work.

Plans:
- Get flask to run 
- Complete Milestone: Prepare Presentation and Final Submission
