We made decent progress this week as a team. Most of us completed our tasks this
week in a timely manner but there seemed to be a lack of communication again that will
be addressed. Overall we got the work done but moving forward there needs to be more
organization in the future. We really just need to get on top of the work lord and start
working ahead this week.
Our tasks for the coming week should be to assign the work for our project. We need to
pick who will perform what tasks (HTML, Python, Front-end, Back-end, etc.). We also
need to start the testing phase of our software.
Our team plans to meet this Thursday to work on our next project assignment dealing
with Testing. As the week goes on we plan to discuss some ideas with each other
concerning how we want to go about this.
