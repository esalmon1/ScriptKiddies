Status report 2:
Section 1: In looking at this week's agenda it seems to be like we do not have a whole
ton of specific group work but I would like to keep adding the necessary files to our
repository in order to keep track of everything. We will work together on making the
base of the program. The fundamentals that will consist of what we need for the project.
Section 2: This week we worked together to construct a wireframe that detailed a
majority of the features of our application. We did this on draw.io and we divided the
work up evenly amongst ourselves. We also thought that we should build a logo for our
discussion board and a name that we are going to use for it. We decided upon “Kiwi”
and built an attention grabbing yet modern logo.
Section 3: we will have more work to do this week compared to last week. For this week
we need to develop an effective data flow diagram to represent the app. This is really
important so that everyone who will be coding and developing the project will be able to
have the same reference point.
