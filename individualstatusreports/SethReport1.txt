1. Nothing this week (first week)
2. We added some additional features as a group. We also used user stories for our posts. The only issue I have trouble with is the git stuff but other than that I am good. The assignment wasn’t very hard to understand. 
3. The goals for the following week are to make sure we work on the task and finish in a good time like stated in the team report.
