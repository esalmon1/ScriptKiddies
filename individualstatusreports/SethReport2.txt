For this week we got all our stuff done on time and even early to make sure we can revise our progress if needed. I stated last week that we should get everything done in an orderly fashion and we did that. 

This week I was able to learn to use the editing software application to create a visual for how we want our application to look like. For the most part I feel all our designs look really good and can be made into a working product. 

This upcoming week we are going to use data flow diagrams to show how our application should work. The diagram will show the information for processes or the system.
