For this week we got all our stuff done on time and even early to make sure we can revise our progress if needed. I stated last week that we should get everything done in an orderly fashion and we did that. 

We created data diagrams to show flow of processes and also a Lo-Fi prototype. These are going to help us with functions and where we need them to go.

This week we are testing our user stories and also creating feature files. We feel comfortable as a group that we can get this done, since we have been on track the whole time during the group work.
