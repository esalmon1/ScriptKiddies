Team Status Report
Our team plans to meet this Thursday to work on our next project assignment dealing with wireframing. As the week goes on we plan to discuss some ideas with each other concerning how we want the pages to look, and then assign them to each member.
Our goals were to basically get everything set up like github, trello, and work our schedules to see what would work best for the group. We also want to make sure that we get all our stuff on time and done right. We completed all tasks for last week.
